<h2>How it's made:</h2>
<p><b>Tech used:</b> React, styled-components, react-nanoid, react-confetti</p>
<p>It is a simple application by nature but it requires state management and synchorinzation
<br>which mad reactjs the prefect choice. Also, i got to practice my react skills on the way.</p>

<br />
<br />
<h2>Optimatizations:</h2>
<p><i>(Optional)</i></p>
<p>Add a rolls section that displays how many times user has rolled the dice.
<br>Make it interesting by  adding a maximum rolls per game. Like game levels,
<br>allow the user to choose how challenging they want to play.</p>

<p>Make it multiplayer? We can use libraries like Socket.io to acheive this.</p>

<br />
<br />
<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
<p>The biggest lesson from this project was how React is an absolute delight when it comes
<br>to state management. It makes it easy to sync every part of the project.</p>
